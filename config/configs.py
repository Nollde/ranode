# GRAVITATIONAL WAVE MODE: Time window in milliseconds
# Signal region for GW detection (centered around signal peak at ~150 ms)
SR_MIN = 100.0  # ms - lower bound of signal region
SR_MAX = 200.0  # ms - upper bound of signal region

# Original particle physics values (commented out):
# SR_MIN = 3.3 # TeV
# SR_MAX = 3.7 # TeV
